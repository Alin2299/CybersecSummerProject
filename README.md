## About the project
The Summer Research project was focused on Cybersecurity, and it was done as part of a 10-week scholarship over the aforementioned summer break.
It involved analysing network security in New Zealand and Australia using internet scanning and the Python programming language (and associated data analysis libraries such as Pandas).
